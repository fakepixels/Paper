<p class="Section">1.Introduction</p>
    <p class="BodyText">Inspired by a conversation with a close friend, I meditated on the upside of being public. Through writing publicly, I’ve met great friends, mentors, and thought partners by sharing my thoughts online. However, with the rapid commoditization of public writing as a means of professional performance as well as the increasing scrutiny over our own words and actions by centralized platforms, some thoughts become riskier to share, while they might oftentimes be the best, or most provocative and creative, thoughts.</p>

    <p class="BodyText">  This page is a token of trust. There will be no more than 15 people in a group like this at any given time. People can trickle in and out, but I hope we can all respect the secrecy of the space. The goal here isn’t exclusivity but simply trust. I hope by being private, we can have fruitful and productive discussions among friends whose thoughts I deeply respect and admire.</p> 

    <p class="BodyText"> After a few attempts at maintaining Telegram groups, Slack groups, campus groups, I learned the operational challenge of fostering truly meaningful discussions when your real reputation is on the line. That’s why I want to do it a bit differently this time. </p>
    
    <p class="BodyText"> The group will stay virtual for now. Group members have the right to not reveal their real-life identities. If anybody violates the privacy of the group… ugh, just don’t do it. I’m not trying to create a Fight Club, but well, it’s a classic for a reason. </p>

<p class="Section">2.Goal</p> 

    <ol class="BodyText">
        <li>Learning with others who:
            <ul>
                <li>wish to refine the craft of learning</li>
                <li>wish to seek truths</li>
                <li>wish to profoundly understand the complexities of the world</li>
                <li>wish to act on the newly discovered truths</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </br>
        <li>Public research</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of us here are likely practitioners in the real world, fidgeting with questions, questioning the status quo, and unsatisfied with the complacency of the average.</li> 
            <li>The explorations happening here is as gratifying and challenging as attending grad schools of social sciences etc.</li>
            </ul>
    </br>
        <li>Collaborative execution</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk is nothing without actions. Being intellectually rigorous and curious is a prerequisite, but is far from sufficient. I hope we hold each other accountable to also execute on our collective ideas by investing or building great enterprises, publishing knowledge and ideas, and mobilizing communities.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
